Protects content of your WordPress pages and posts.

== Description ==

"Protect Pages & Posts" plugin protects your WordPress pages and posts on demand. 

Your WordPress website may have some private pages and posts that you only want certain people to see them. "Protect Pages & Posts" plugin helps you just that. It is designed to protect both your WordPress pages and posts. In other words, your private content is no longer accessible by other people until you share its private URLs with them.

PROTECT WORDPRESS PAGES & POSTS

Our plugin protects your WordPress pages and posts. Once protected, they cannot be accessed directly by their original URLs. If people attempt to access this private content directly via its original URLs, they will be redirected to your 404 error page. 

AUTO-GENERATE PRIVATE URLS

Our plugin will automatically generate a Private URL containing random strings for you to see that content. This private URL is the ONLY way to access the protected content.
You can get that private URL to clipboard and subsequently paste it on your browsers or email by [clicking on the Copy URL button](https://www.buildwps.com/documentation/protect-wordpress-pages-posts/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_medium=plugin-repo&utm_campaign=under-private-urls). 

BLOCK GOOGLE FROM INDEXING YOUR PAGES & POSTS

"Protect Pages & Posts" plugin explicitly tells Google and other search engines [not to index](https://www.buildwps.com/documentation/protect-wordpress-pages-posts/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_medium=plugin-repo&utm_campaign=under-index-google) any of your protected content so that your pages and posts and original URLs will never appear on the search results.
